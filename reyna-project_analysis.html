<h1>Project Analysis</hi>
<h2>Site Intent</h2>
<p>The obvious intent of Tropical Transport is to make a profit in the transportation business.  The site, however, has a sense of instability and an amateur appearance.  The color scheme doesn't mesh.  The flash "Welcome" is distracting.  So their attempt to appear as a professional service is greatly hindered by the initial impact of the site."</p>
<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
<p>A Bing search of "orlando transportation services" provided 77,100,000 results.  Can we say that the competition is intense?  The top listing is orlandoluxurylimo.com.  This site is better but still unimpressive.  The second listing, orlandohotelshuttles.com is much better.  It's brief and to the point.  Even doing a search of "orlando tropical transport," the site does not appear until position six.  There's some work to be done in streamlining the site and SEO.</p>
<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
<p>Who's going to Orlando?  Where are they coming from?  Why are they going?  Where do want to go when they get there?  What's the busiest airport?  Of course, people from all over the world want to go to Disney World, Epcot Center, Universal City and other attractions. Orlando International is the second busiest airport in Florida so you will want to emphasize that the transportation service is easily accessed there.  The main target audience is tourists.  Business people who need a shuttle service while in the city are a major target. Third would be the local residents who need an occasional ride to the airport or some other location that the taxi service could provide.  I like the idea of page in Spanish but what the French, Germans, or others who are traveling to Orlando?  Perhaps a "site translator" might work after a lot of testing.
